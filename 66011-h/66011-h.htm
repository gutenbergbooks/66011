<p>The year 1956 marked the 50th Anniversary of the establishment
of Devils Tower National Monument, the first of our national
monuments. The same year was likewise the Golden
Anniversary of the enactment of the Antiquities Act which
authorized the President, by proclamation, to set aside &ldquo;historical
landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other
objects of historic or scientific interest that are upon the lands
owned or controlled by the United States as National Monuments.&rdquo;
Under this law and subsequent authorizations, 80
national monuments have now been established.</p>
<p>All who have seen the gigantic stump-like formation, known
as Devils Tower, rising some 1,200 feet above the Belle Fourche
River, will understand why it inspired the imagination of the
Indians. They called it <b>Mateo Tepee</b>, meaning Grizzly Bear
Lodge, and had several legends regarding its origin. According
to the Kiowas, who at one time are reputed to have lived
in the region, their tribe once camped in a stream where
there were many bears. One day seven little girls were playing
at a distance from the village and were chased by some
bears. The girls ran toward the village and when the bears
were about to catch them, they jumped to a low rock about
three feet in height. One of them prayed to the rock, &ldquo;Rock,
take pity on us&mdash;Rock, save us.&rdquo; The rock heard them and
began to elongate itself upwards, pushing the children higher
and higher out of reach of the bears. When the bears jumped
at them they scratched the rock, broke their claws and fell
back upon the ground. The rock continued to push the children
upward into the sky while the bears jumped at them. The
children are still in the sky, seven little stars in a group (the
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
pleiades). According to the legend, the marks of the bears&rsquo;
claws may be seen on the side of the rock.</p>

<p class="pcap">Indian legend depicting the origin of Devils Tower.

</div>
<p>The Cheyenne version of the origin of the Tower is somewhat
different. According to their legend, there were seven brothers.
When the wife of the oldest brother went out to fix the smoke
wings of her tipi, a big bear carried her away to his cave. Her
husband mourned her loss deeply and would go out and cry
defiantly to the bear. The youngest of the brothers was a medicine
man and had great powers. He told the oldest one to go
out and make a bow and four blunt arrows. Two arrows were
to be painted red and set with eagle feathers; the other two
were to be painted black and set with buzzard feathers. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
youngest brother then took the bow and small arrows, told the
older brothers to fill their quivers with arrows and they all went
out after the big bear. At the entrance of the cave, the younger
brother told the others to sit down and wait. He then turned
himself into a gopher and dug a big hole in the bear&rsquo;s den.
When he crawled in he found the bear lying with his head on
the woman&rsquo;s lap. He then put the bear to sleep and changed
himself back into an Indian. He then had the woman crawl
back to the entrance where the six brothers were waiting.
Then the hole closed up. After the Indians hurried away, the
bear awoke. He started after them taking all the bears of
which he was the leader.</p>
<p>The Indians finally came to the place where Devils Tower
now stands. The youngest boy always carried a small rock in
his hand. He told his six brothers and the woman to close their
eyes. He sang a song. When he had finished the rock had
grown. He sang four times and when he had finished singing
the rock was just as high as it is today. When the bears
reached the Tower, the brothers killed all of the bears except
the leader, who kept jumping against the rock. His claws
made the marks that are on the rock today. The youngest
brother then shot two black arrows and a red arrow without
effect. His last arrow killed the bear. The youngest brother
then made a noise like a bald eagle. Four eagles came. They
took hold of the eagles&rsquo; legs and were carried to the ground.</p>
<p>The Tower also was an object of curiosity to the early white
explorers. Although early fur traders and others probably saw
the gigantic formation at a distance, none ever mentioned it in
their journals. Lt. G. K. Warren&rsquo;s Expedition of 1855 passed
through the Black Hills en route from Fort Laramie to Fort
Pierre but probably never was within sight of it. In 1857, Warren,
accompanied by Dr. F. V. Hayden and others started from
Fort Laramie to explore the Black Hills and then returned to the
Missouri via the Niobrara River. At Inyan Kara, they met a
large party of Sioux who threatened to attack if they attempted
to advance farther. While here, Warren reported seeing the
&ldquo;Bear&rsquo;s Lodge&rdquo; and &ldquo;Little Missouri Buttes&rdquo; to the north through
a powerful spy-glass. It is not known if he was referring to the
Bear Lodge Mountains or to the Tower itself. The explorers
retraced their route 40 miles and took another route eastward
instead of the one originally planned. When Capt. W. F. Raynolds&rsquo;
Yellowstone Expedition passed through the Black Hills
region two years later, J. T. Hutton, topographer, and the Sioux
interpreter, Zephyr Recontre, on July 20 reached the Tower
and returned to the Expedition&rsquo;s camp on the Little Missouri
River. Neither Warren nor Raynolds, however, left descriptions
of the formation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>It remained for the U. S. Geological Survey party, who made
a reconnaissance of the Black Hills in 1875, to call attention to
the uniqueness of the Tower. Col. Richard I. Dodge, commander
of the military escort, described it in the following year as
&ldquo;one of the most remarkable peaks in this or any country.&rdquo;
Henry Newton (1845-1877), geological assistant to the expedition,
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... Its (the tower&rsquo;s) remarkable structure, its symmetry, and its prominence
made it an unfailing object of wonder.... It is a great remarkable
obelisk of trachyte, with a columnar structure, giving it a vertically stratiated
appearance, and it rises 625 feet almost perpendicular, from its base.
Its summit is so entirely inaccessible that the energetic explorer, to whom
the ascent of an ordinary difficult crag is but a pleasant pastime, standing
at its base could only look upward in despair of ever planting his feet
on the top....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Colonel Dodge is generally credited with giving the formation
it present name. In his book entitled <b>The Black Hills</b>, published
in 1876, he called it &ldquo;Devils Tower,&rdquo; explaining &ldquo;The Indians
call this shaft The Bad God&rsquo;s Tower, a name adopted
with proper modification, by our surveyors.&rdquo; Newton, whose
published work on the survey appeared in 1880, explained
that the name Bear Lodge (Mateo Tepee) &ldquo;appears on the
earliest map of the region, and though more recently it is said
to be known among the Indians as 'the bad god&rsquo;s tower,&rsquo; or in
better English, 'the devil&rsquo;s tower,&rsquo; the former name, well applied,
is still retained.&rdquo; However, since that time, the name
Devils Tower has been generally used. Geologists, on the
other hand, have in some instances continued to use the
original name.</p>
<p>Over the years there have been changing theories concerning
the origin of Devils Tower. The latest belief, based upon
the most extensive geological field work yet done, probably
will be supported by further study.</p>
<p>Briefly stated, about 60 million years ago when the Rocky
Mountains were formed, there was similar upheaval which
produced the Black Hills and associated mountains. Great
masses of very hot, plastic material from within welled up
into the earth&rsquo;s crust. In some instances it reached the surface
to produce lava flows or spectacular explosive volcanoes
which spread layers of ash many feet over a vast part of the
Great Plains.</p>
<p>In the Devils Tower vicinity, this slowly upsurging, heated
earth substance spent its force before reaching the surface,
cooling and becoming solid within the upper layers of the
earth. During this process probably a very large mass of it,
many miles across, moved within a few thousand feet of the
surface. Before it cooled, fingers or branches of pasty-textured
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
material moved upward along lines of weakness in the rock
layers near the surface of the earth. Some of these pinched
out, while others formed local masses of varying size and
shape. Devils Tower and the nearby Missouri Buttes, as we
know them today, represent some of these offshoot bodies
which solidified in approximately their present size and form
at depths of possibly one to two thousand feet beneath the
surface. The phonolite porphyry, as the rock of Devils Tower
and the Missouri Buttes is known, is very hard.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="772" />
<p class="pcap">The rock formation of Devils Tower is Phonolite Porphyry.
<i>Courtesy National Park Service.</i></p>
</div>
<p>During subsequent tens of millions of years, erosion has
stripped away the softer rock layers in which these masses
formed, leaving them standing as dominant landmarks. The
process continues today as the Belle Fourche and Little Missouri
Rivers and their tributary streams, aided by freezing,
thawing, rain drops, and the other processes that break down
the rock, continue to alter the face of the earth in this region.</p>
<p>Within less than a decade after the U. S. Geological Survey
party passed through the region, the first settlers were to enter
the western end of the Black Hills in which the Tower is located.
The Treaty of 1868 guaranteed this region to the Indians.
In 1874, in violation of this treaty, Gen. George A. Custer led a
reconnaissance expedition into the Black Hills. As the result of
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
his reports of the discovery of gold in paying quantities in the
Hills, miners invaded the region. While the Government attempted
to negotiate with the Indians to purchase the Hills,
the Army endeavored to keep out the intruders. When the
negotiations broke down in 1875, the troops were withdrawn
and miners and settlers poured into the region. Towns such
as Custer City and Deadwood sprung up over night. Many
of the Indians, as a result, became convinced that they would
lose their reservations in the Dakotas, Wyoming and Montana
and joined the hostiles. By early 1876 the Government found
a full-scale Indian war on its hands. Following the battle of
the Little Bighorn in June, the Army pursued the hostile groups
relentlessly. In the fall of that year the Indians were compelled
to cede the Black Hills and most of their lands in Wyoming
to the whites. For several years, however, small marauding
groups continued to wander through the region.</p>
<p>By the end of the decade, the vicinity around Devils Tower
was comparatively safe for settlers. In the early 1880&rsquo;s the
first of these came into the Belle Fourche Valley in the vicinity
of Hulett. With the exception of such outfits as the Camp Stool
and the D (Driscoll), most of these settlers were small-scale
farmers and ranchers from the mid-western states. In the
vicinity of Moorcroft and the Tower, on the other hand, most
of the land was occupied by large-scale outfits, such as the
101. From 1889 to 1892, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy
Railroad extended its line from the South Dakota State Line
through Newcastle, Moorcroft and thence to Sheridan. From
several points along this line, the Tower may be seen in the
distance. It is not unreasonable to conjecture, therefore, that
the railroad may have had some influence in the movement
to give the area national protection.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Government took early action to prevent the
Tower from passing into the hands of individuals who might
wish to exploit the scenic wonder for private gain. In February
1890, Charles Graham filed a preemption application for
the lands on which the Tower is situated. In August of the
same year, the General Land Office issued an order to reject
all applications on these lands. This order forestalled other
attempts to acquire the Tower for speculative purposes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, support grew for the idea of preserving the Tower
as a national or state park. In February 1892, Senator Francis
E. Warren (1884-1929) of Wyoming wrote the Commissioner of
the General Land Office asking him for assistance in preventing
the spoilation of Devils Tower and the Little Missouri
Buttes, located several miles to the northeast. Several weeks
later, the Land Office issued an order setting aside, under the
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Forest Reserve Act of March 3, 1891, some 60.5 square miles,
which included both the Tower and the Little Missouri Buttes,
as a temporary forest reserve. This reserve was reduced in
June 1892 to 18.75 square miles and the unreserved portion in
1898 was restored to settlement.</p>
<p>In the same year, Senator Warren introduced a bill (S. 3364)
in the United States Senate for the establishment of &ldquo;Devils
Tower National Park.&rdquo; Acting on the advice of the General
Land Office, the Senator requested in his proposal that 18.75
square miles or 11,974.24 acres, which included both Devils
Tower and the Little Missouri Buttes, be set aside for the park.
The bill, which was introduced on July 1, 1892, was read twice
by its title and referred to the Committee on Territories. It
appears that Congress took no further action on the proposal.</p>
<p>It was not until fourteen years later that Devils Tower became
a national monument. Although the proposal to make
the area a national park apparently did not receive much public
support, the proponents were sufficiently influential to keep
it in timber reserve status. Following the passage of the Antiquities
Act in June 1906, Frank W. Mondell (1860-1939), Representative-at-large
from Wyoming and resident of Newcastle,
lent his support to the plan to have the area preserved as a
national monument. Mondell was a member and later chairman
of the important House Committee on Public Lands. It
was apparently as the result of his influence, more than that
of any other individual, that President Theodore Roosevelt,
on September 24, 1906, proclaimed Devils Tower as a national
monument. Upon the recommendation of the Commissioner
of the General Land Office, the acreage set aside was only
1,152.91 acres, believed by him to be &ldquo;sufficiently large to
provide for the proper care and management of the monument&rdquo;
under the terms of the Antiquities Act. The Little Missouri
Buttes were not included in the monument area. The
remainder of the reserve was opened to settlement in 1908.</p>
<p>The question whether President Theodore Roosevelt ever
visited Devils Tower is a matter of conjecture. Some elderly
residents of the region claim that he visited the place on one
of his hunting trips through the Black Hills; others, that he
dedicated the monument when it was established. The writer
has been unable to find any contemporary letters or newspaper
accounts which show that he visited the Tower at any
time. On April 25, 1903, while on an extended tour through
the West, Roosevelt made train stops at Gillette, Moorcroft and
Newcastle, Wyoming; and at Edgemont and Ardmore, South
Dakota. The several Wyoming newspapers published in
September 1906, which were consulted by the writer, made
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
no mention whatever of the Tower receiving national monument
status.</p>

</div>
<p>Although it was difficult to reach, the Tower early became a
favorite camping and picnicking spot for people living in the
vicinity. One of the inviting features was the large spring of
pure cold water located near its base. It was some distance
from a railroad so it could be reached only over unimproved
roads or trails by horseback, wagon or buckboard. One long-time
resident of Hulett, some ten miles distant from the monument
by present paved highway, informed the writer that in
the 1890&rsquo;s, it was necessary to ford the Belle Fourche River
seven times to get to the tower. Many of the people in the
vicinity went to the Tower once or twice a year and spent
one or two nights there. The Fourth of July observances for
the community were sometimes held there and people often
came from considerable distance to these events.</p>
<p>The best-known early event was the 4th of July celebration
held at the Tower in 1893. According to the handbill circulated
for the occasion, the principal speakers were N. K. Griggs of
Beatrice, Nebraska, and Col. William R. Steele of Deadwood,
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
South Dakota. The handbill announced &ldquo;There will be plenty
to Eat and Drink on the Grounds;&rdquo; &ldquo;Lots of Hay and Grain for
Horses;&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Dancing Day and Night.&rdquo; It also stated &ldquo;Perfect
order will be maintained.&rdquo; The feature attraction, however,
of the day was to be the first climbing of the Tower by
William Rogers, a local rancher. The event was apparently
given wide publicity.</p>
<p>Rogers made elaborate preparations for the big event. With
the assistance of Willard Ripley, another local rancher, he prepared
a 350-foot ladder to the summit of the Tower. This was
accomplished by driving pegs, cut from native oak, ash and
willow, 24 to 30 inches in length and sharpened on one end,
into a continuous vertical crack found between the two columns
on the southeast side of the giant formation. The pegs were
then braced and secured to each other by a continuous wooden
strip to which the outer end of each peg was fastened. Before
making the exhibition ascent, the men took a 12-foot flagpole
to the top and planted it into the ground. The building of the
ladder by Rogers and Ripley was an undertaking perhaps
more hazardous than the climbing of the Tower itself.</p>

</div>
<p>People came for a distance from 100 to 125 miles to witness
the first formal ascent of the Tower. The more conservative
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
estimates are that about 1,000 people came by horseback,
wagon and buckboard to see the spectacular feat. For many
of them it was a trip requiring several days of tedious travel
over rough and dusty trails. Rogers began his ascent following
proper ceremonies which included an invocation. After
climbing for about an hour he reached the top. Amid much
cheering from the many open-mouthed spectators some 865
feet below, he unfurled an American flag, which had been
specially made for the occasion, from the flagpole. Devils
Tower had at last been conquered in the full view of an assembled
throng. During the afternoon, a gust of wind tore the
flag loose and it drifted down to the base of the Tower. Here
the promoters tore it up and sold the pieces for souvenirs.</p>
<p>Others were soon to climb the Tower by Rogers&rsquo; ladder. On
July 4, 1895, Mrs. Rogers duplicated her husband&rsquo;s climb of two
years earlier and became the first woman to reach the summit.
It is estimated that 25 people have made the ascent of the
Tower by Rogers&rsquo; ladder. The last to reach the top by this
means was &ldquo;Babe&rdquo; White, &ldquo;the Human Fly,&rdquo; in 1927. Much
of the ladder has since been destroyed. However, a portion
of it may still be seen on the southeast side of the Tower. A
viewing device on the Tower trail assists the visitor to locate
the remnants of the ladder.</p>
<p>Almost a quarter of a century was to pass after Devils Tower
was given national recognition before a full-time National Park
Service employee was to be stationed at the monument. Consequently,
there is little information about the area for the
period from 1906 to 1930. When the monument was established,
the Commissioner of the General Land Office directed the
Special Agent of the district in which the area was located and
the local Land Office to act as custodians of the newly-created
area. They were to prevent vandalism, removal of objects and
all unauthorized occupation or settlement of lands on the monument.
Mr. E. O. Fuller, of Laramie, served with the Sundance
office of that agency as special investigator from 1908 to 1919.
He informed the writer that, among his various duties, he was
charged with the responsibility of looking after the Tower. Mr.
Fuller related to the writer that on one occasion a Wyoming
newspaper carried an article indicating that souvenir hunters
were damaging the Tower by chipping it. The story soon
reached the East, and within a short time one New York and
several Washington, D. C., papers were carrying alarming
stories that the giant formation was being undermined and
seriously threatened. The fear was voiced that, if measures
were not taken immediately to prevent it, the famous landmark
would soon be destroyed. As a result of this publicity,
the Commissioner of the General Land Office sent out instructions
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
to place warning signs on the monument asking people
not to molest the Tower. It was Mr. Fuller&rsquo;s responsibility to
post these signs on the area. He visited the place from time
to time to prevent people from destroying trees and damaging
the natural features of the area.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Congressman Mondell made persistent efforts to
interest the Federal Government in developing the monument
as a tourist attraction. In February 1910, he introduced a bill
(H.R. 21897) providing for an appropriation to build an iron
stairway from the foot to the summit of Devils Tower. The
proposal was referred to the Committee on Appropriations and
apparently never reported out. In 1911 and 1913 Mondell re-introduced
identical bills (H.R. 8792 and H.R. 88) to the earlier
one in the 62nd and 63rd Congress and they too died in the
committee. In 1915 and 1917, he introduced bills (H.R. 165 and
60) to provide for the building of roads at the monument &ldquo;and
for other purposes.&rdquo; These met the same fate as the earlier
bills. Mondell, however, continued to urge the Secretary of
Interior and the Director of the National Park Service to build a
bridge across the Belle Fourche River, east of the monument,
and construct a suitable access road to the area.</p>
<p>With the popularizing of the automobile, the need for visitors&rsquo;
facilities on the area increased. In 1916, the National Park Service
was organized and the monument was placed under its
jurisdiction. Prior to 1917, Congress made no general appropriations
for the protection and maintenance of the national
monuments. Until the 1930&rsquo;s the amounts allotted for this purpose
continued to be very small. Various groups continued to
urge for a satisfactory access road to the area and for a bridge
across the Belle Fourche River near the monument. Early in
1915, Mondell transmitted a request to the Secretary of the Interior
from the three legislators from Crook County asking Congress
for funds to build a road to the Tower. At a picnic held
at the monument on July 4, 1916, which was attended by some
500 people, a petition was drafted and signed by 153 persons
and sent to Congressman Mondell. The petitioners complained
that they had been compelled to walk a mile and a half that
day over a trail which was &ldquo;washed out and filled with logs&rdquo;
in order to reach the Tower. They asked Congress for an appropriation
of $20,000 to convert the giant formation into a public
resort and to build a bridge across the Belle Fourche. Pressure
from the various groups through Congressman Mondell
was soon to bring some results. In 1917 the National Park
Service, with the assistance of Crook County, built a 12 to 16-foot
road three miles in length and with a grade of eight percent
leading to the giant formation. In the following year, this
road was improved so that it could be reached more easily by
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
automobile. The spring at the base of the Tower was also
made more serviceable.</p>
<p>It was some time, however, before pressure was sufficiently
strong to compel the Federal Government to build a bridge
across the Belle Fourche near the monument. For many years,
it had been necessary for those entering the area from the
east to ford the river. During the summer months, the river
was subject to sudden and unpredictable rises which frequently
made it impossible for people visiting the area to return to
the east bank until the water subsided. In many instances,
those so stranded were compelled to camp out one, and in
some cases, several nights. Pressure from local people and
travel organizations to build the bridge continued to be strong
throughout the early 1920&rsquo;s. In 1923, a petition, containing
seven pages of signatures of people from Wyoming and South
Dakota, was submitted to the Secretary of the Interior asking
that the Belle Fourche near the monument be bridged. Both
Senators Warren and John B. Kendrick lent their support to
the movement. It was not until 1928 that the bridge was built.</p>
<p>During the 1920&rsquo;s the National Park Service was able to
provide only the most minimum accommodations for visitors
at Devils Tower. Some work continued to be done in maintaining
the roads. In 1921 John M. Thorn, County Commissioner of
Crook County, of Hulett, was appointed custodian at an annual
salary of $12 a year. Thorn served primarily as foreman of
maintenance work and performed the minimum paper work
necessary in preparing payrolls and making purchases. In
1922 the Service built a log shelter to protect the visitors from
inclement weather, cleaned the spring next to the Tower and
improved the road within the monument boundaries. However,
in spite of the improvements the Government was able
to make, the maintenance at the monument must have been
very inadequate. Trespassing stock continued to graze on the
area and occupy the log shelter erected for visitors. The Secretary
of Custer Battlefield Highway Association complained to
the Director in 1929 that the road to the Tower the previous
year &ldquo;was a disgrace, many people turned back because of
the terrible road conditions.&rdquo; He also pointed out that the
area needed a full-time custodian.</p>
<p>Despite the hardships in reaching the Tower and the lack of
accommodations after reaching there, visitation to the area
continued to rise during the 1920&rsquo;s. &ldquo;The monument is receiving
an increasing number of visitors who like to camp on the
ground,&rdquo; reported the Director in 1922. From 1921 to 1930 the
estimated number of visitors rose from 7,000 to 14,720, the average
being 9,100. After 1925 a register was kept at Grenier&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Store which was located near the east entrance to the monument.</p>
<p>During this period the National Park Service was under continued
pressure to authorize concessions at the Tower. Numerous
applications were made by individuals and companies to
erect restaurants, gasoline stations, hotels and recreational
facilities there. The Service consistently maintained that such
developments of a permanent character should be made outside
the monument boundaries and not within the area itself.</p>
<p>It has only been since 1930 that Devils Tower National Monument
has become a national tourist attraction. This has been
the result of several factors. During the latter part of the 1920&rsquo;s,
the Custer Battlefield Highway (U.S. Highway 14) was built
between Spearfish, South Dakota, and Gillette, Wyoming, and
came within only seven miles of the Tower. The State also
built improved roads into Sundance from U.S. Highways 85
and 16. A paved highway was also constructed from U.S.
Highway 14 to Alva making the area from the south entirely
accessible by paved roads. Local and state Chambers of
Commerce, travel associations, newspapers and periodicals
gave the Tower wide publicity as one of the natural &ldquo;wonders
of the world.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>The decade of the 1930&rsquo;s was one of extensive development
for the monument. Although the Nation was in the throes of
the Great Depression, considerable sums of money as well as
manpower were made available for public works through the
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
various relief agencies. Working under the supervision of the
National Park Service, these agencies, particularly the Civilian
Conservation Corps, inaugurated an extensive development
program at the monument. Practically all of the improvements
prior to 1956 were the results of their efforts. New roads were
built, modern water and electrical systems installed, footpaths
were laid out, picnic areas were established with tables and
comfortable benches, and trailer and overnight camping areas
were provided the visitors. Residences for employees, workshops
and machine shops were erected. In 1938 a museum of
sturdy log construction was completed.</p>
<p>The result of the improved roads and visitor facilities at the
monument is reflected in travel records. During the ten-year
period from 1931 to 1941, in spite of the Great Depression, the
number of visitors practically tripled. In 1931 the count was
11,000; in 1936, 26,503; in 1941, 32,951.</p>
<p>In the early 1930&rsquo;s, the first full-time custodian was stationed
at the monument. This was George C. Crowe, who previously
had been a Ranger-Naturalist at Yosemite National Park in
California. Crowe served from April or May 1931 until March
1932 when he was transferred to Yellowstone National Park
as Assistant Park Naturalist. Newell F. Joyner, who earlier had
seen service at Yellowstone as Ranger and Naturalist succeeded
Crowe as Custodian. Joyner served in this capacity for 15
years.</p>
<p>The big annual event each year at the monument, the
Pioneers&rsquo; Picnic, had its origin at this time. Although old-timers
frequently met at the Tower prior to that time, it was
not until 1932 that they formally organized. In that year, the
Northern Black Hills Pioneer Association came into being. Its
membership was limited to people who had resided in that
section for at least 35 years. On one day each year, usually in
June, an open house is held in remembrance of this occasion.</p>
<p>In the late 1930&rsquo;s, professional mountain climbers gave their
attention to Devils Tower. Although the summit of the giant
formation had by then been reached a number of times by
means of the ladder which Rogers had built in 1893, no one
had reached the top without this device. With the consent of
the National Park Service, three mountain climbers, all members
of the American Alpine Club of New York City, led by
Fritz Wiessner, in 1937 made the first ascent of the Tower
solely by rock-climbing techniques. They reached the top in
four hours and forty-six minutes. This party made many
scientific observations and brought down samples of the rock
as well as vegetation found there. Eleven years later 16 members
of the Iowa Mountain Climbers Club, after reaching the
summit, hoisted bedding and food and spent the night. As
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
of December 31, 1975, there have been 4,051 individual ascents
of the formation by skilled climbers. It was not until 1955
that James McCarthy and John Rupley made the first ascent
on the west face. At the present time, there are 49 different
routes and all sides of the tower have now been climbed.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1941 the Tower made the headlines of the Nation&rsquo;s
leading newspapers. This was brought about through
the foolhardy stunt of a professional parachutist named George
Hopkins. Without the consent or knowledge of National Park
Service officials, Hopkins, who held a number of United States
and world&rsquo;s records for spectacular jumps, on October 1 parachuted
from an airplane to the top of the Tower. His plan was
to make his descent by means of a one-half inch 1,000-foot
rope which was dropped from the plane. However, this rope
landed on the side of the Tower and Hopkins was unable to
get it. The Park Service was confronted with a serious problem,
and newspapers throughout the country made the most of
the predicament. Telegrams and letters offering advice on
how to rescue Hopkins came from all over the United States.
Meanwhile, food and blankets were dropped to him while
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
Service officials considered how to get the man down from
the giant formation.</p>
<p>After weighing carefully various methods, the Service, on
October 3, decided to accept the offer of Jack Durrance, a student
at Dartmouth College, skier and mountain climber who
had led the second mountain-climbing ascent of the Tower in
1938, to lead the rescue party. More food, water, and blankets
were dropped to Hopkins and assurances were given him that
help was coming. Advice and offers of assistance continued.
The Goodyear Company offered to loan the use of a blimp to
effect the rescue. The Navy offered the use of a helicopter.
Bad weather, meanwhile, grounded Durrance&rsquo;s plane, so the
mountain climber had to travel to Denver by train. On October
5, Durrance and his party arrived at the monument. Working
closely with Service officials, they laid out a safe climbing
route for rescue operations. On the following day, Durrance
led seven other climbers to the summit of the tower where they
found Hopkins who, in spite of his ordeal, was in excellent
physical condition and in good spirits. The descent was made
with little difficulty. The stranded stunt man and the rescue
operations which received wide publicity attracted many spectators
from all parts of the Nation. During the six-day period,
some 7,000 visitors came to the monument to see him and witness
rescue operations.</p>
<p>Within a few months following the Hopkins episode, the
United States entered World War II. Travel to the National
Park Service areas, except by members of the Armed Forces,
was not encouraged. Personnel, as well as appropriations,
needed to maintain the areas, were reduced to a minimum.
Gas and tire rationing, together with reduced vacation time
resulting from the War effort, was soon to be reflected in reduced
travel figures. In 1942 the visitors at the monument
numbered 20,874; in 1943, 5,114; 1944, 6,024; 1945, 7,315.</p>
<p>In 1947 Raymond W. McIntyre succeeded Joyner as Superintendent
of the monument. McIntyre, a native of North Dakota,
was Park Ranger at Glacier National Park immediately
prior to entering on duty at the Tower. He had previously
served in the capacity of Ranger at Mount McKinley National
Park in Alaska and a Ranger with the U.S. Forest Service.</p>
<p>James F. Hartzell replaced Raymond W. McIntyre as Superintendent
of the Monument in January of 1958. Hartzell, a
native of Minnesota was a Park Ranger at Olympic National
Park in Washington prior to his entering on duty as Superintendent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>In April 1963, Robert J. Murphy succeeded James F. Hartzell
as Superintendent of the Monument. Murphy is a native of
Montana, and started his career with the National Park Service
as a park ranger at Yellowstone National Park in 1942.
Successive assignments included Glacier National Park in Montana,
Theodore Roosevelt National Memorial Park in North
Dakota; Rocky Mountain National Park and Shadow Mountain
National Recreation Area in Colorado and Wind Cave National
Park in South Dakota.</p>
<p>Richard T. Hart replaced Robert J. Murphy in May, 1966 as
the Monument&rsquo;s Superintendent. Hart, a native of South Dakota
and former teacher, served first as a Park Ranger and
later as Park Naturalist at Wind Cave National Park and Jewel
Cave National Monument in South Dakota. He was assigned
to Yosemite National Park in California as Assistant Park
Naturalist in 1960 and to the Mather Training Center in Harpers
Ferry, West Virginia as an Instructor (Interpretation) in 1963.</p>
<p>In December 1968, Elvin T. Aaberg was appointed Acting
Superintendent of the monument. Aaberg, a native of South
Dakota, first served as a Park Ranger at Wind Cave National
Park in South Dakota and later at Glacier National Park in
Montana.</p>
<p>In June 1970, Homer A. Robinson was appointed Superintendent.
A native of Oregon, Robinson began his career as a
Park Ranger at Montezuma Castle National Monument in
Arizona in 1959. Successive assignments included Canyon
De Chelly National Monument in Arizona; Jewel Cave National
Monument in South Dakota; Lake Mead National Recreation
Area in Arizona and Nevada; Port Jefferson National Monument
and Everglades National Park in Florida.</p>
<p>Increased visitation following World War II brought about
new problems of protection, public use, interpretation, development
and all other phases of park operations. A long range
planning program known as MISSION 66 was inaugurated.
Improvements to each of the areas were programmed and
many completed. Improvements that were completed at Devils
Tower included the enlargement of camping facilities, additional
housing, improvement of the trail around the Tower, additional
water and sewer developments, administration and
equipment buildings and the enlargement of the visitor center.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
